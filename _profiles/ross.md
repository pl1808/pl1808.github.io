Ross's interest in racing started from a young age from when he went to school on the Epsom Downsand would rarely miss an afternoon at the races. His Head teacher remarked he should focus on studying anything apart from the horse's form!  From as early thirteen year's old he dreamt about one day having a runner in the Derby.

Ross got more closely involved with horse ownership for the first time at University, where with his friend and flat mate's father was involved with a horse that won first time out at Wolverhampton and 7 times in total.

Since 2009 he and fellow racing enthusiast Andrew Harding have run a friends and family syndicate Palatinate Thoroughbred Racing that have had runners and winners with Karl Burke, David Pipe,  Johnny Farrelly, Brian Meehan, Ian Williams and Michael Wigham. He has bought nice horses with highlights including Credit Swap 7 time winner of the 2010 Cambridgeshire handicap bought for 7000 guineas won £175k in prize money, multiple winning sprinter Fairway to Heaven that was rated 96 and won the Windsor Super Sprint in 2014. 8 times flat and hurdles winning listed flat horse War Singer and the Richard Hannon trained Producer for £11k which won the International Topkapi Trophy Group 2, Criterion Stakes Group 3, Richard III Listed Stakes, Group 3 Supreme Stakes at Goodwood and Listed Surrey Stakes at Epsom that resulted in £440k in prize money being won. Finally  Tee it up Tommo who won 6 times on the All Weather in just one season. Bought for 3k euros and named after our racing ambassador Derek Tommo Thompson. He has also had success in selling Glasgow Gailes and Superboot to new owners in America.

Through his business interests Ross sponsors jockeys Frankie Dettori and Jim Crowley, enjoys hosting guests at Ascot (his second favourite course after Epsom) and has become feared by the bookies for their infamous mass participation Christmas Sting!
