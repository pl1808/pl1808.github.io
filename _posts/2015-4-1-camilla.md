Daughter of Champion National Hunt trainer Nicky Henderson, Camilla has been directly or indirectly involved within the racing industry her whole life. It's in her blood. 

Camilla started out riding ponies when she was younger, to then go on and pursue her Three Day Eventing career, riding at National and International level before going to Bristol University to study Psychology. Now she holds a Dual Cat B Amateur license (under rules), and rides regularly in point to points over the winter. She has a great passion for racing and has been extremely enthusiastic with all her work over the last few years working within the industry.

Managing a racing club in Berkshire for three years, she is client communications manager and events manager as well as working on significant race days and events for JSC Sport, including the Investec Derby every year. In the summer she rides for Charlie Hills and Brian Meehan daily, thoroughly enjoying it. In the national hunt season she is very much involved at Seven Barrows, riding out regularly for my father. Currently building up her new business, she works as an Applied Sport Psychologist under the BPS & HPC, working at Bristol Rugby, Cinderford RFU & Swindon Town FC, as well as consulting a number of professional athletes within individual sports.
